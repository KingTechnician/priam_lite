# Priam

 - Are you a Virginia State University student who has a change they would like to make known to the university administration?
 - Are you unsure of the resources or means necessary?

A solution presented by me, Isaiah Freeman, is Priam, a web application that has the goal of making the desires of students more visisble to faculty and administration to Virginia State University.

## How?

- The Priam system is simple; you might consider it a voting system. Students have the ability to create an account, and propose changes they would like to make to the university in a short post.
- Categories can be added to the posts to better organize the nature of their requests.
- Other users have the ability to view these public posts and have the option to upvote them.
- These posts are anonymous. No one will know that you posted it.
- There are no comments. No one can dismiss your request.
- The only metric is the upvote button.

There are also basic searching methods to allow you to search posts by name, title or date (filtering by category coming soon).

## Are Your Requests Actionable?

- An extension to the Priam application is coming soon. This extension will take the posts made so far and analyze them using charts, graphs, and various other visualizations to determine the highest categories of interest, most upvoted posts, and other important results from your posts.

- The goal would be to have this data tabulated and sent to administration on a monthly or semester-wide basis.

## How Can We Make This System Happen?

- This system, along with continuous iterations and/or redirections rely solely on you, fellow Trojans! By garnering your feedback, I can continue to develop this to become something that can prove a change in yours and future students' VSU experience.

This system is live at the moment! A link to the app will be coming soon. When it does, I encourage you to try out this service. By contributing your thoughts, you will provide data that can help greater happen here.
